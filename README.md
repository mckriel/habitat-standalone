# Habitat Arcadian Forest Festival Guide

A simple progressive web app with offline support
Can be installed locally on users devices
Displays lineup information and directions to get to the festival
Festivals have poor signal and users often struggle to find event information

Origina stack used Django, python, javascript, html and css. Decided to create a standalone version to host on my github page
